# Python mines sweeper
Hello everyone :)\
Hope you are all doing well\
This is a simple project that I'm working on, written in python\
a simple mines sweeper replication with a couple more features, like abilities\
all of which made on kivy and using python 3.11\

# Abilities
There are currently three abilities:
- Cell Reveal: shows you a 5 by 5 grid of cells, with their identity
